## 2018 Wrapup

Wow, what a weekend.  The weather once again proved magical on the farm.  Early
in the week it looked really dodgy.  Cold, rainy, chance of snow, all around
nasty conditions.  As it seems to happen the forcast cleared up for the weekend.
It was cold but not unbearable and ended up being quite pleasant and a little
sunny on Saturday and the round robin matches began.  After quite a bit of rain
(and a little snow) overnight on Saturday, things cleared up for Sunday's matches.
It was soggy and muddy in places but umbrella's were put away.

In the Shine division defending champs Unity Farm (aka the home team) was the team
to beat again this year and they didn't disapoint. The only team to go 2-0 in
their first two matches they picked up a quick 41 points and never seemed to look
back, finishing with 114 points.  Team PHO-CUS responded to some early struggles
against Unity by dominating their matches against the Brunswick Co Baggers and the
Port City Players, securing a fairly easy second place finish after round robin
play.

In the Moon division it was a dogfight from the beginning.  DFC, GVDG and River's
Edge Aces were back and forth from the beginning with DFC distancing themselves
with a 8-1-0 finish against River's Edge Aces in round 4.  Meanwhile GVDG kept
the pressure up with consistent matchplay wins never letting a match get too far
out of reach and racking up points.  Nearing the end of the round robin matches
DFC was in a comfortable lead but GVDG and River's Edge Aces were locked in a battle.
With all the results in but 1 match the two were tied with 81 points.  The deciding
match went to GVDG and pushed them into the Semifinals with 84 points.

In the Semifinals, it was Unity taking on GVDG and DFC taking on PHO-CUS.  The
top seeds were able to hold serve, both defeating their opponents 6-3.

In the finals Unity proved to be a lot for DFC to handle.  The open1, open2, and
Lady1 seeds all jumped out to early leads.  As match results came in it was soon
apparent that Unity was about to lay claim to the Jug for a second time.  Eventually
defeating DFC 7-0 (with 2 matches stopped since their result didn't matter).

Personally I'd like to the thank all the Captains and players.  We pulled this
year together on much shorter notice than in the past.  I'd also like to thank
Cutt, Staci and the Farm's ground crew (CJ, RB, Durl, and anyone else).  The
farm always looks great but this year it looked the best I've ever seen it.

As always a portion of entry fees went to [Steve Johnson's Parkinson's Disease Fund](https://www.gofundme.com/xe94vpg8)
($200) as well as to the Blessed Kitchen Food bank ($100).

Stay tuned for info on next year's NCTI around December.
