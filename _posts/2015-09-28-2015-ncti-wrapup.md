The 2015 North Carolina Team Invitation is in the books.  Despite some very wet
weather on Saturday 11 Teams slugged it out for a chance to play for the Jug.
After the conclusion of group play the semi-finals were set.

Both semi-final matches came down to the wire, with both #2 seeds taking out
the #1s.  Craven Chains bested GreenvilleDGC 4-3, while TCP bested C4 4-3 with
some Pro seed upsets and stellar play by their underated Wildcard seed.

The finals came down to Craven Chains taking on TCP for the right to hoist the
jug.  Another nail-biting match followed as the sun came out and shown down on
the farm.  TCP Master's seed, Ken Tyberski leading the way (6-0), TCP defeated
Craven Chains 4-3 and are the 2015 NCTI Champions.

Huge thanks to all the Team Captains, their players, and escpecially Cutt and
Stacy for their hospitality.

Congratuations and a big thank you to TCP and their team captain Bobby Henn for
their victory, and Bobby's help with scores.


See everyone next year... Watch this space for more details!
