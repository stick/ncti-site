What an amazing weekend.  First a big thanks to all the Captains and Players who
attended this year.

We had fantastic weather, quite cold at night and brisk in the mornings, but both
days turned into fantastic sunny days and Sunday was quite warm.  

Round Robin play began Saturday morning and continued into Sunday.  Clear favorites
emerged after Day 1 with GVDG leading the pack in the Moon division, while Unity
Farm had a commanding lead in the Shine division.  DFC and PhoCus maintained their
solid 2nd places in their respective divisions and seemed to be biding their time.

The Semi-finals began with GVDG taking on PhoCus while Unity Battled DFC.  It was
to be the year of the underdog as both 2 seeds won the semi-finals with both matches
going down to the wire 5-4.  The Unity/DFC match had high drama as the M2 card passed
the clubhouse and had to play the 873' #3 in a deciding hole.  The long walk back to the
clubhouse was eagerly awaiting by both teams who waited for news of victory or defeat.
Robert McAlpine defeated Carlton Howard to give DFC the victory and push DFC into the finals.

There was similar drama in the other semi-final as GVDG and PhoCus's match came
down to the Ladies match when all the other matches were decided and tied at 4-4.
Becky Trojan defeated Michelle Green and pushed PhoCus into the finals.

The finals began as both teams seemed happy to be there and get over the hump into the finals.
In what seemed to be the theme for the day there was drama in the finals as well.
Most of the matches finished around the same time but it looked like PhoCus had a commanding lead
with early results being 4-1.  However as each new result came in DFC crept closer and closer.
As everything was tallied the final score was DFC 5 to PhoCus 4.

Congratulation to Captain Brad Smith and Team DFC out of Hickory!
A big thanks to everyone who played and especially Cutt and the Farm's ground crew.
The course looked amazing.  A special thanks to those who helped spot on holes 17 and 18.

See everyone next year!
