The 2016 North Carolina Team Invitational is in the books.  Despite bleak looking
weather conditions forcasted during the week, the luck and magic of the farm held
out and we were lucky to have very pleasant conditions and very little rain.  Quite
a bit of rain at night meant the course was fairly soggy but no rain during the
matches kept everything on schedule.

After 6 rounds of matches the standings were finalized.

The Moon division turned out to be a bit of a group of death, though stellar play
by the home team allowed them to come out on top.  After a bit of a shakey start
C4 distanced themselves with 2 dominating rounds.

In the Shine division Greenville and Triad made it a two horse race, with the 
division lead coming down the final few matches.  Eventually Triad put themselves
on top.

In the Semi's C4 had Triad's number nearly sweeping them (7-1) to cruise into the
finals.  In the other half of the bracket Unitty defeated Greenville (6-3) to face
first year champs C4 in the finals.

After a day of overcast and dreary conditions the finals began with a light rain,
however this would not last as the rain departed after a few holes and the sun came
out.  With the sun came Unitty's victory (5-3) over C4 with 1 match not being completed
as the results were decided and the celebration began.

Thanks again to all the Captains, Players and especially to the Farm Grounds Crew.

See you next year!!
