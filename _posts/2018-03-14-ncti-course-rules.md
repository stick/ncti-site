#### General OB

- Anywhere off the property
- Unless noted OB for one hole is OB on all holes
- Inside, underneath, or on top of any building or structure
- Goat pen, if you need to go in for retrevial Jeff The goat is generally friendly just make sure you shut the gate so they don't wander out.

- Do not litter, ESPECIALLY cigarette butts, pick up all trash even if it's not yours.  Littering is grounds for DQ, banishment and removal from the property.
