Originally inspired by the Virginia Team Invitational, the North Carolina Team
Invitational is a team based, match play,  disc golf competition.  Teams compete
against each other in a series of matches to earn points and make the playoffs.

The winner has their team forever imortalized on the NCTI trophy, this trophy is
passed from winner to winner each year.

## Tournament Director and Mastermind

    I wanted to create a team matchplay event.  I felt that North Carolina would
    benefit from having a first class event much like VTI.  Cutt was gracious
    enough to share his course and share my vision.  Together I think we've made
    something that North Carolina Disc golf can be proud of.
