Each Team will consist of 7 members.

- 3 Pros
- 1 Ringer
- 1 Masters
- 1 Amateur
- 1 Woman

Starting with 2015 if you play for a team you cannot play for another team the
the following year.  You must either play for the same team or sit out 1 year.
Women are excempt from this rule and may play for any team at any time.

Pro
: Must be current resident of team's home state

Ringer
: No restrictions, may be from any location
: Ringers are a set seed, they will only play other ringers

Master
: Must be current resident of team's home state
: Age 40 or higher during the calendar year of the event

Amateur
: Must be current resident of team's home state
: PDGA rating must be below 950
: must be a current PDGA member (to insure current rating)
: Cannot have accepted cash in a PDGA event (no amnesty)

Woman
: Must be current resident of team's home state

Each team may only have 2 players who's current pdga rating is over 1000.

The ringer spot is designed to allow teams to have an honor spot for someone who
isn't from their home state.  There are no restrictions on this spot.  However 
a player denoted as the ringer will only play the other ringers on other teams
and cannot be seeded in any other place.

Teams may designate up to 2 alternates.  Alternates can be one-time subbed in
for any seed (except the ringer) that they qualify for.  Once you replace a
player you cannot sub them back in again.
