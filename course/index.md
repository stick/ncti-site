UniŦy Farm affectionally known as Ŧhe Farm is a working pine tree farm on the
outskirts of Louisburg, NC.  This beautiful property is the family farm of the
Land Family.  Owner and course designer Jason 'Cutt' Land works tirelessly on
improving the course and has many different layouts available.  For NCTI we
play a mixed layout that encorporates several par 4 (and a few par 5) holes as
well as technical par 3 holes to raise the challenge of matchplay.

**Remember UniŦy Farm is private property.  Do NOT show up to play without
prior permission.**
