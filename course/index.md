UniŦy Farm affectionally known as Ŧhe Farm is a working pine tree farm on the 
outskirts of Louisburg, NC.  This XXX acre property is the family farm of the Land
Family and has been in their family for XX years.  Owner and course designer Jason
'Cutt' Land works tirelessly on improving the course and has many different layouts
available.  For NCTI we play a mixed layout that encorporates several par 4 (and
a few par 5) holes as well as technical par 3 holes to raise the challenge of 
matchplay.
