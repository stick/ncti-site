Matchplay is a different animal.  It involves strategy and focused aggression.

[Official PDGA Matchplay Rules](https://www.pdga.com/rules/official-rules-disc-golf/appendix-a)

Matchplay is based on whoever wins the most holes.  If you score lower than your
opponent you have won that hole (1UP).  As the match proceeds you may come to a
point where you are up the same number of holes as remain.  This is referred to 
as being dormie-X or just dormie.  For example in a 9 hole match if I am 3-UP
with 3 holes to play then I am dormie-3.  I only need to half or win the next hole to
win the match.

All match results should be reported as holes up / holes remaining for tie-breaking
purposes. For example If I am 3UP with 3 to play and my opponent and I half the hole,
I would win "3 and 2".  If I won that hole the match result would be "4 and 2" (4UP with 2 remaining).
