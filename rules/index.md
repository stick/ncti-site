Matchplay is a different animal.  It involves strategy and focused aggression.

Matchplay is based on whoever wins the most holes.  If you score lower than your
opponent you have won that hole (1UP).  As the match proceeds you may come to a
point where you are up the same number of holes as remain.  This is referred to 
as being dormie-X or just dormie.  For example in a 9 hole match if I am 3-UP
with 3 holes to play I am dormie-3.  I only need to half or win the next hole to
win the match.

## Rules Specific to Matchplay

* Any shot can be conceeded (given) by you or your opponent.  Conceeded shots 
  should be given, never asked for.  It is the players sole discretion of a shot
  is to be conceeded.
* A hole may be conceeded at any time.  It is the players sole discretion to conceed
  a hole or not.
