Each team consists of 9 team members, see [The Teams](/teams/) for team makeup.

There are 8 Teams split into 2 divisions, the Moon division and the
Shine division.

## Group Play

Each team member will play 6 matches over the course of 2 days, 4 matches on Saturday, 2 match Sunday morning.

Each match will be 10 holes, singles, seed vs seed,  [standard matchplay](/matchplay-rules/).

Each match is worth 2 points,
so each round there are 18 available points for your team.
Matches tied after 10 holes are a draw, each team will be awarded 1 point.

At the conclusion of group play, the 2 teams with the most points in their respective
divisions will play in the semis.

Group tiebreakers are team holes won, followed by holes remaining.

Team A: 36 points; won 18 matches all 1 and 0 (1UP with 0 holes remaining)
Team B: 36 points; won 18 matches all 2 and 1 (2UP with 1 hole remaining)

Team B (36pts / 18 pts) would hold the first and second tiebreaker over Team A (18pts / 0pts). So in short it's always better
to win big and win early than let your opponent linger on and win at the end.

## The Semis

The #1 seed in the Moon division will play the #2 seed in the Shine division.
The #1 seed in the Shine division will play the #2 seed in the Moon division.

Each team member will play a 10 hole match against their opponent seed.  Matches
must have a winner and will play sudden death on the next hole if tied after 10 holes.

## The Finals
